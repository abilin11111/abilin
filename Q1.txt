Now we are going to create an HTML form to take your username and 
password to store in a mysql database using PHP

1. Create an html form in the location of /var/www/html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Form site</title>
</head>
<body>
<form method="post" action="myform.php">
Username: <input type="text" name="uname"><br><br>
Password: <input type="password" name="upassword"><br><br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>


2. Save and exit the file

3. Next create a database and table in mysql

3.1. Login to mysql


3.2. Enter the password for user root (This will be your class password: 'Testwebpw1$')

3.3. Create a database with the name myDB.

3.4. View the list of databases

3.5. Create a table ‘user in database ‘myDB’

3.6. Check the structure of the above created table



# Login to MySQL
mysql -u root -p

# Enter the password for user root ('Testwebpw1$')

# Create a database with the name myDB
CREATE DATABASE myDB;

# View the list of databases
SHOW DATABASES;

# Use the myDB database
USE myDB;

# Create a table 'user' in the database 'myDB'
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

# Check the structure of the above-created table
DESCRIBE user;

# Exit MySQL
exit;



3.7. Finally create the php file which connect both html and mysql database.

<?php
$host = "localhost";
$dbusername = "root";
$dbpassword = "Testwebpw1$";
$dbname = "myDB";
//Create Connection
$conn = new mysqli ($host, $dbusername, $dbpassword, 
$dbname);
$username = $_POST['uname'];
$password = $_POST['upassword'];
//Insert value in database table
$sql = "INSERT INTO user (name, password) values 
('$username', '$password')";
if($conn->query($sql)){
echo "New record is inserted successfully";
}
else {
echo "Error: ". $sql . "<br>". $conn->error;
}
$conn->close();
?>

4. Save the file and exit

5. Now open the HTML form and test it using your browser.
